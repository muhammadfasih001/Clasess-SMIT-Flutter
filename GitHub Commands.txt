Git And GitHub Complete Guide:

1. Install Git: Download and install Git on your Laptop/PC from the official website. Git is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

First Time Setu up:

2. Configure Git: Set up your name and email address using the following commands:

   git config --global user.name "Username"
   git config --global user.email "email@gmail.com"

   This information is used to identify your commits.

3. Initialize a repository: Create a new Git repository for your project using the `git init` command. This will set up a new repository in the current directory.

4. Add files: Start tracking files by adding them to the Git repository using the `git add` command. For example, to add a file named "main.dart":

   git add main.dart
   git add . 
   You can also use `git add .` to add all files in the current directory.

5. Commit changes: Save the changes you've made to the repository with a commit using the `git commit` command. A commit includes a message that describes the changes made.

   git commit -m "Initial commit message"
   The `-m` flag is used to specify the commit message inline.

6. View repository status: Check the current status of your repository with the `git status` command. It shows which files have been modified, added, or deleted.

7. View commit history: See the commit history using the `git log` command. It displays a list of commits with their respective messages, authors, dates, and commit IDs.

8. Push changes: Share your local repository with a remote repository, such as one hosted on GitHub, using the `git push` command.

    git push origin master
    This pushes your local "master" branch to the remote repository named "origin."

9. Pull changes: Get the latest changes from a remote repository into your local repository using the `git pull` command.

    git pull origin master
    This fetches the latest changes from the "main" branch of the remote repository named "origin" and merges them into your local branch.

10. Clone a repository: Create a copy of a remote repository on your local machine using the `git clone` command.

    git clone <repository_url>
    Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the remote repository you want to clone.
